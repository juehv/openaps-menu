# openaps-menu

This is the repository holding the menu-based software code, which you may choose to add to an Explorer HAT or other screen-based rig (e.g., Adafruit Radiofruit Bonnet) in order to visualize and enter information into a Pi-based #OpenAPS rig.

See [here](https://github.com/EnhancedRadioDevices/Explorer-HAT) for more details on the Explorer HAT hardware.

You can set your preferred auto-updating status screen using the following setting in your `~/myopenaps/preferences.json`:

`"status_screen": "bigbgstatus"` will display the big BG status screen (no graph).

`"status_screen": "textstatus"` will display a text based status screen with extended information (no graph).

`"status_screen": "off"` will not auto-update the status screen.

`"status_screen": "blank"` will wipe the screen during the auto-update, but will wake up when you press a button to let you access menu options.

By default, the auto-updating status script will invert the display about 50% of the time, to prevent burn-in on the OLED screen. You can turn this off with the following setting in your `~/myopenaps/preferences.json`:

`"wearOLEDevenly": "off"`

Or you can have it invert the display from 8pm to 8am with:

`"wearOLEDevenly": "nightandday"`
